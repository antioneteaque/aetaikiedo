Last night I came up with the expression (f(U)-f(V))/(g(Uùõ•V)) where g(Uùõ•V) is a function of the symmetric difference of U and V that's equal to 0 if U=V. Here's where my uncertainty comes in. Right off the bat it felt pretty weird writing "As V goes to U" because I don't know what that means. All I can visualize is two blobs of jello trying to match each others' shape and calling it "n-dimensional stuff", which wouldn't be a problem if I had any other idea remotely worth working –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É–π—Ç–µ –∑–∞—â–∏—Ç—É –æ—Ç –ø–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–∏ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≤ Dr.Web Security Space. –í–∏–¥–µ–æ –æ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫–µ –∑–∞—â–∏—Ç—ã –æ—Ç –ø–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–∏.

Every morning I wake up thinking how convenient it would be if pipes didn't exist. If everything were barreled. Want to shower? Crack open a barrel of water. Want some tea?

Extending this crack philosophy to Factorio, I designed this oil refining setup that tries to minimize pipes as much as possible. ~~Ver 1. Picture: https://i.imgur.com/1bD3AOr.jpg~~ ~~Ver 2.
